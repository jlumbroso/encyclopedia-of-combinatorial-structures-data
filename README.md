## Introduction

This repository contains a subset of the `algolib` v17 distribution dedicated to the Encyclopedia of Combinatorial Structures. This subset is used to generate a portable JSON file storing all the information in a convenient format.

## History

The Encyclopedia of Combinatorial Structures is a project started by Stéphanie Petit-Halajda in 1998, as she was visiting the Algorithms Project at INRIA in Rocquencourt. It built on the work of many other visitors to the Algorithms Project, and sought to combine the automatic enumeration and construction conveniences of `combstruct` (Marni Mishna, Eithne Murray, Paul Zimmerman, ...) and the automatic asymptotic extraction functionality of `gdev` (Bruno Salvy, Frédéric Chyzak, ...) in a convenient self-contained form.

In 2011, Frédéric Chyzak and Alexis Darrasse created a web platform, [DynaMoW](http://ddmf.msr-inria.inria.fr/DynaMoW/), in OCaml, that had strong integration with Maple on the backend. The goal was to enable to creation of websites facilitating interactive exploration. Several specific websites were intended: The [Dynamic Dictionary of Mathematical Functions (DDMF)](http://ddmf.msr-inria.inria.fr/1.9.1/ddmf) and a revamped version of the [Encyclopedia of Combinatorial Structures (ECS)](http://ecs.inria.fr/).
